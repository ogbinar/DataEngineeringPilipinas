## Mentoring Program 2024

### Objective

To create a network of mentors and mentees within the DE Pilipinas community, focusing on personalized advice and skill development in data engineering.

### Three Easy Steps

![Mentoring Program - pubmat2](images/DEP - Mentoring Program - pubmat2.png)

1. **Sign Up & Share**: Fill out a quick form to tell us about your skills, interests, and what you’re looking for—whether you want to mentor, learn, or both!
2. **Pick Your Match**: Browse profiles to find your perfect mentor or mentee. Start the conversation to see if you click, and set up a call to seal the deal.
3. **Learn & Grow Together**: Dive into your mentorship journey, set goals, and check in regularly. Your feedback helps us make the experience even better for everyone.

### Data Collection

- Utilize forms to collect information from potential mentors and mentees, including areas of expertise or interest, preferred contact methods, and availability.
- Information to be updated regularly to ensure it reflects current details.
- Participants must give consent for their information to be shared for pairing purposes.
- Mentors [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaFU5DEu99s0e4CW3400GUIb6jOHf08Ab6eHl1uYF18dN5XA/viewform).
- Mentees [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU-7wRgeWZ1-qqFzkeUb-GHG3b5Ot7ZSSf56OCWA_pbpSHiw/viewform).

### Pairing Mechanism

- **Self-Initiated Pairing**: Mentors and mentees can select their pairs based on the information provided in the forms.
- Both mentors and mentees are urged to initiate contact, ideally outlining why they believe a partnership would be beneficial and providing relevant information to help the other party determine if there’s a mentor-mentee fit.
- Once both parties initially agree to the pairing, they are encouraged to conduct a needs assessment call to confirm compatibility before officially commencing the program.
- A mentor can have multiple mentees, but a mentee can have one mentor at a time. One can be both a mentor and a mentee.
- To find a mentor and/or a mentee, [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVuhgRbFO-TtNYGmTHNWY8oe33MxMrLZ7VSSNGahC64/edit?usp=sharing).

### Mentor Commitment

- Our program places a strong emphasis on supporting our mentors. We believe that by taking good care of our experts, they in turn will be

 better equipped to nurture their mentees.
- Mentors can specify the number of mentees they are willing to take on and their preferred mentoring strategy: some mentors may prefer a hands-on approach, actively guiding mentees through specific technical stacks. Others may opt for a more advisory role, providing strategic guidance and holding regular check-ins. This allows for a personalized mentorship experience that caters to the unique learning styles and objectives of each mentee.
- Options for mentor involvement levels help prevent burnout and ensure a productive mentoring relationship.

### Mentee Engagement

- Mentees can identify their career stage and the type of help they need, allowing mentors to select mentees based on their expertise and interest areas.
- Mentees play an active role in this mentorship program. They are expected to demonstrate a strong desire for learning and growth, as the value of the mentorship relationship is directly proportional to their commitment and engagement. Mentees are encouraged to take the initiative in following up, setting up meetings, and driving their learning journey. A balanced approach is expected, one that involves proactive engagement from the mentees while ensuring that the mentor’s time is respected.

### Feedback and Improvement

- Regular follow-ups and feedback collection from both mentors and mentees to assess the effectiveness of the mentorship and make necessary adjustments.
- Consider running polls within the group for additional feedback and suggestions.

### FAQs

**Can I participate if I’m not from the Philippines?**
Yes.

**Is the mentoring program free?**
Yes.

**Is there a certification or recognition at the end of the program?**
None. [Maybe in the future recognition for mentors, for mentees, the mentoring is the benefit :D]

**Can the mentor-mentee match be changed?**
Yes, as long as both parties are informed.

## Mentoring Program 2024

### Objective

To create a network of mentors and mentees within the DE Pilipinas community, focusing on personalized advice and skill development in data engineering.

### Three Easy Steps

![Mentoring Program - pubmat2](images/DEP - Mentoring Program - pubmat2.png)

1. **Sign Up & Share**: Fill out a quick form to tell us about your skills, interests, and what you’re looking for—whether you want to mentor, learn, or both!
2. **Pick Your Match**: Browse profiles to find your perfect mentor or mentee. Start the conversation to see if you click, and set up a call to seal the deal.
3. **Learn & Grow Together**: Dive into your mentorship journey, set goals, and check in regularly. Your feedback helps us make the experience even better for everyone.

### Data Collection

- Utilize forms to collect information from potential mentors and mentees, including areas of expertise or interest, preferred contact methods, and availability.
- Information to be updated regularly to ensure it reflects current details.
- Participants must give consent for their information to be shared for pairing purposes.
- Mentors [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaFU5DEu99s0e4CW3400GUIb6jOHf08Ab6eHl1uYF18dN5XA/viewform).
- Mentees [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU-7wRgeWZ1-qqFzkeUb-GHG3b5Ot7ZSSf56OCWA_pbpSHiw/viewform).

### Pairing Mechanism

- **Self-Initiated Pairing**: Mentors and mentees can select their pairs based on the information provided in the forms.
- Both mentors and mentees are urged to initiate contact, ideally outlining why they believe a partnership would be beneficial and providing relevant information to help the other party determine if there’s a mentor-mentee fit.
- Once both parties initially agree to the pairing, they are encouraged to conduct a needs assessment call to confirm compatibility before officially commencing the program.
- A mentor can have multiple mentees, but a mentee can have one mentor at a time. One can be both a mentor and a mentee.
- To find a mentor and/or a mentee, [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVuhgRbFO-TtNYGmTHNWY8oe33MxMrLZ7VSSNGahC64/edit?usp=sharing).

### Mentor Commitment

- Our program places a strong emphasis on supporting our mentors. We believe that by taking good care of our experts, they in turn will be

 better equipped to nurture their mentees.
- Mentors can specify the number of mentees they are willing to take on and their preferred mentoring strategy: some mentors may prefer a hands-on approach, actively guiding mentees through specific technical stacks. Others may opt for a more advisory role, providing strategic guidance and holding regular check-ins. This allows for a personalized mentorship experience that caters to the unique learning styles and objectives of each mentee.
- Options for mentor involvement levels help prevent burnout and ensure a productive mentoring relationship.

### Mentee Engagement

- Mentees can identify their career stage and the type of help they need, allowing mentors to select mentees based on their expertise and interest areas.
- Mentees play an active role in this mentorship program. They are expected to demonstrate a strong desire for learning and growth, as the value of the mentorship relationship is directly proportional to their commitment and engagement. Mentees are encouraged to take the initiative in following up, setting up meetings, and driving their learning journey. A balanced approach is expected, one that involves proactive engagement from the mentees while ensuring that the mentor’s time is respected.

### Feedback and Improvement

- Regular follow-ups and feedback collection from both mentors and mentees to assess the effectiveness of the mentorship and make necessary adjustments.
- Consider running polls within the group for additional feedback and suggestions.

### FAQs

**Can I participate if I’m not from the Philippines?**
Yes.

**Is the mentoring program free?**
Yes.

**Is there a certification or recognition at the end of the program?**
None. [Maybe in the future recognition for mentors, for mentees, the mentoring is the benefit :D]

**Can the mentor-mentee match be changed?**
Yes, as long as both parties are informed.
