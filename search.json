Start the conversation to see if you click, and set up a call to seal the deal.\nLearn & Grow Together: Dive into your mentorship journey, set goals, and check in regularly. Your feedback helps us make the experience even better for everyone.\n\n\n\nData Collection\n\nUtilize forms to collect information from potential mentors and mentees, including areas of expertise or interest, preferred contact methods, and availability.\nInformation to be updated regularly to ensure it reflects current details.\nParticipants must give consent for their information to be shared for pairing purposes.\nMentors register here.\nMentees register here.\n\n\n\nPairing Mechanism\n\nSelf-Initiated Pairing: Mentors and mentees can select their pairs based on the information provided in the forms.\nBoth mentors and mentees are urged to initiate contact, ideally outlining why they believe a partnership would be beneficial and providing relevant information to help the other party determine if there’s a mentor-mentee fit.\nOnce both parties initially agree to the pairing, they are encouraged to conduct a needs assessment call to confirm compatibility before officially commencing the program.\nA mentor can have multiple mentees, but a mentee can have one mentor at a time. One can be both a mentor and a mentee.\nTo find a mentor and/or a mentee, click here.\n\n\n\nMentor Commitment\n\nOur program places a strong emphasis on supporting our mentors. We believe that by taking good care of our experts, they in turn will be\n\nbetter equipped to nurture their mentees. - Mentors can specify the number of mentees they are willing to take on and their preferred mentoring strategy: some mentors may prefer a hands-on approach, actively guiding mentees through specific technical stacks. Others may opt for a more advisory role, providing strategic guidance and holding regular check-ins. This allows for a personalized mentorship experience that caters to the unique learning styles and objectives of each mentee. - Options for mentor involvement levels help prevent burnout and ensure a productive mentoring relationship.\n\n\nMentee Engagement\n\nMentees can identify their career stage and the type of help they need, allowing mentors to select mentees based on their expertise and interest areas.\nMentees play an active role in this mentorship program. They are expected to demonstrate a strong desire for learning and growth, as the value of the mentorship relationship is directly proportional to their commitment and engagement. Mentees are encouraged to take the initiative in following up, setting up meetings, and driving their learning journey. A balanced approach is expected, one that involves proactive engagement from the mentees while ensuring that the mentor’s time is respected.\n\n\n\nFeedback and Improvement\n\nRegular follow-ups and feedback collection from both mentors and mentees to assess the effectiveness of the mentorship and make necessary adjustments.\nConsider running polls within the group for additional feedback and suggestions.\n\n\n\nFAQs\nCan I participate if I’m not from the Philippines? Yes.\nIs the mentoring program free? Yes.\nIs there a certification or recognition at the end of the program? None. [Maybe in the future recognition for mentors, for mentees, the mentoring is the benefit :D]\nCan the mentor-mentee match be changed? Yes, as long as both parties are informed."

When mock_data is written to a CSV file, it results in a 1.3 GB file. Writing this to the DB will take some time.
