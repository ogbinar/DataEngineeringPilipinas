An introduction to databases using SQL, a language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.

Create, read, update, and delete data with tables, triggers, and constraints, and how to model real-world entities and relationships among them.

Normalize data to avoid redundancies and errors, how to join tables with primary and foreign keys, and how to create views and indexes to optimize searches.

Starts with SQLite, a portable database engine, and ends with PostgreSQL and MySQL, scalable database systems. The course uses Python and Java to connect SQL with other languages.

Inspired by real-world datasets, such as movies, houses, flights, and countries. The course is offered by HarvardX on edX.
